# slicereg
Registration of 2D sections to a 3D volume


The aim of `slicereg` is to be the 2D companion of 
[amap](https://github.com/SainsburyWellcomeCentre/amap-python) to provide 
registration of 2D brain tissue sections (of any kind) to a 3D brain atlas 
such as the [Allen Reference Atlas](http://mouse.brain-map.org/). 

Features (e.g. labelled cells) in these sections can then be transformed 
into a common coordinate space of the brain atlas, and features from
multiple samples can be visualised together 
(e.g. in [brainrender](https://github.com/BrancoLab/BrainRender)).

All results will be compatible and interoperable with 
[cellfinder](https://github.com/SainsburyWellcomeCentre/cellfinder), 
[amap](https://github.com/SainsburyWellcomeCentre/amap-python),
[neuro](https://github.com/SainsburyWellcomeCentre/neuro),
[brainrender](https://github.com/BrancoLab/BrainRender), and ideally any 
other similar tools.
